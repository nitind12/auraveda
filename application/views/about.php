                <h1 class="title"> <span> Our Objective </span> </h1>
                <p align="justify"> After thoroughly considering the pathogenesis of disorder, an effective drug endowed with qualities will be administered, in such a way that disease may be alleviated without producing harmful side effects. That is why Ayurveda acharya Charaka has said that the therapy, which pacifies one disorder, but, at the same time, gives rise to some other disorder is not correct. The correct one is that which while pacifying a disorder does not excite the other one. So the drug & treatment modalities will be chosen in such a way that while alleviating the disorder it should not produce adverse side effects so that equilibrium is restored. </p>
